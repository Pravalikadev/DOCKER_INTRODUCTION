Y DOCKER : to over the drawbacks of :
let's discuss with examples
let's take an example of 3-tier architecture: 3-tier architecture means the applications which contains front-end, middleware and backend
front-end: html, css, js, react ( web-server)
middleware: java, python, ruby, c# ( API )
backend: sql, Mysql, mongodb ( Database-server )
if u want to test the application then we need a OS, if u run the entire application in a single OS then it won't work bcz of different dependencies and libraries used in that application
then how will u test it with the libraries and dependencies ????????????
